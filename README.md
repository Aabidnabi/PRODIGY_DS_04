# Project: Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Brand Perception 

# Overview
In the age of digital communication, understanding public sentiment on social media is crucial for businesses and organizations. This data science project employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data, specifically focusing on Twitter. The goal is to gain deep insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

## Objectives
1. **Analyze sentiment patterns:** Utilize NLP techniques to perform sentiment analysis on social media text data.
2. **Visualize sentiment trends:** Create informative data visualizations to represent sentiment trends over time.
3. **Extract insights from the data:** Dive deep into the sentiment analysis results to extract valuable insights.

# Features
1.Sentiment Analysis: Utilize advanced NLP techniques to determine sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) in Twitter data.
2.Data Collection: Harness the Twitter API to collect relevant and diverse tweets related to chosen topics or brands.
3.Visualization: Create interactive and informative visualizations, including sentiment timelines, word clouds, and sentiment distribution charts.
4.Insight Extraction: Employ data analytics to extract meaningful insights from sentiment analysis results.

## Data
- The project uses a dataset from Twitter containing tweets, entities, and sentiment labels.
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, duplicates, and text cleaning.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA includes visualizations of sentiment distribution, entity distribution, sentiment distribution by entity, and text length analysis.

## NLP Preprocessing
- Text data undergoes NLP preprocessing, including removing special characters, tokenization, converting to lowercase, lemmatization, and stopwords removal.

## Sentiment Analysis
- Sentiment analysis is performed using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
- Sentiments are categorized into positive, negative, and neutral.
- Sentiment distribution is visualized.

## Modeling 
- A sentiment classification model is built using Logistic Regression.
- Data is split into training and testing sets, and features are extracted using TF-IDF vectorization.
- The model is trained and evaluated for sentiment classification.
